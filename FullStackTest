Shop PetStore 
 
Requirements:
1. Make a db schema(table) called Pets, and insert these values
Pet        	Cost
Cat        	40
Bird       	100
Fish       	90
Dog       	50
2. Create a User Login/Registration page so that the user can be authenticated from the DB. A name and password are the minimum requirements for registration (extra fields can be added, but they will be disregarded by us).
3. After Login, show a "Pets Selection Page"  (by fetching details from the DB). A user can buy any number of the above-mentioned pets.
4. Display a Shopping page that will show the above pets and let users select them using a form.
5. Update the userâ€™s selection in the DB upon form submission. Only the ids of the pets should be stored in the Users DB.
6. Redirect the user to the "Pets Selection Page".
7. The details of what the user has selected should be visible in the "Pets Selection Page" the next time he logs in.
 
Note:
Both the Users and Pets DB have to be separate.
The UX/UX aspect is not important, please focus on only the working aspect.
Choose any HTML Input Element to get the users selection.
If any Design Patterns are used, please mention which ones and why it was used.
Please handle all edge cases.
You are free to use the language of your choice.
Unit tests and integration tests would be an added advatage.
